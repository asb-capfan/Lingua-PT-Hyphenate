Lingua/PT/Hyphenate version 1.00
================================

Separates Portuguese words in syllables

  use Lingua::PT::Hyphenate;
    
  @syllables = hyphenate("teste")   # @syllables now hold ('tes', 'te')

Works based on the following rules:

0) Mark special consonant combinations not to separate (like "tr", "vr", etc);

1) Separate consonants (not allowing consonants to be isolated; not
   separating "ch", "lh", "nh");

2) Separate vogals from consonants on their right;

3) Separate vowels from vowels (except for special cases like "ai", "au", etc).

4) Unmark the special consonant combinations marked in step 0)
